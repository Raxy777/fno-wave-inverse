"""
The two gradient gates and the solver re-check (§11.2 steps 9a/9b/10b).

What is testable without a trained network and without minutes of FDTD is the part
most likely to rot: the h-sweep logic that turns two gradients into a number of
digits, the direction metric that decides whether two complex sensitivity columns
point the same way, and the physical-width parameterisation that lets 9b be asked of a
family the dataset never contained.  Those are tested here with stubs and closed forms.

The parts that need the reference solver are marked `slow`.  They are not the point of
this file -- notebook 05 runs the real gates -- but the plumbing between
`solver_receivers` and `InverseCase.d_obs` has one asymmetry in it (A-scan route
versus field-phasor route) that is worth pinning, because getting it wrong biases the
scattered field rather than breaking it.

    The aggregation, tested without the 57 FDTD runs the real thing costs.

    `EPS_INVERT_ANNEAL` is off because the surrogate saw one interface width in
    training, and the schedule's endpoints -- 2.0 cells and 1.0 -- are both
    extrapolations.  What this function must get right is that bracketing the trained
    width does not count as validating it: a pass at 1.5 and failures at the endpoints
    is exactly the situation the anneal would walk into, and `anneal_licensed` has to
    be False there.
