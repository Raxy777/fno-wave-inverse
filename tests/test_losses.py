"""
The training objective (§7), and in particular the physics residual.

Four tests here are load-bearing; the rest are plumbing.

`test_navier_residual_vanishes_on_analytic_plane_waves` is the one that matters most.
The differential scattered-field residual of §7.2 is the only term in the loss whose
*correctness* is not
checked by training converging -- a residual with a sign error, a transposed axis, or a
missing cross term still has a minimum, the network still descends it, and the result is
a network that has learned to satisfy the wrong equation.  So the residual is confronted
with fields for which the exact answer is known analytically: homogeneous plane P and S
waves, propagating both along an axis and along the diagonal.  The diagonal cases are not
decoration -- for an axial wave the shear stress sigma_xy is identically zero, so an
axial-only test would leave three of the eight derivative calls in `navier_residual`
completely unexercised.

The residual on those waves is not zero, and the test does not pretend it is.  It is the
4th-order stencil's own dispersion error, and the test predicts it to six digits from the
closed-form symbol of the stencil: a wave at k dx = theta is differentiated as though its
wavenumber were k * (8 sin(theta) - sin(2 theta)) / (6 theta), so the residual relative to
the inertial term is exactly |1 - that ratio squared|.  At 8 points per wavelength that is
2.34%, which is the floor `losses.py`'s own docstring warns about and the reason alpha is
balanced rather than fixed.  Pinning the value rather than bounding it means the test also
catches a residual that has become *more* accurate than the stencil permits, which would
mean it is no longer computing what it claims to.

`test_physics_loss_is_invariant_to_the_scale_of_the_field` checks the normaliser choice.
Dividing by rho omega^2 |u| rather than by the residual of anything predicted is what
stops "output zero" from being a minimum of the physics term, and it is a one-line change
away from being wrong.

`test_h1_penalises_high_wavenumber_error_far_more_than_l2` puts a number on the reason
L_H1 is in the objective at all: an error moved from wavenumber k to 8k costs the same L2
and 7.3x the H1.

`test_make_context_is_f_major` is the third place in the codebase that the B*F+f
flattening convention appears (the others are `features.pack_inputs` and the loader), and
a context whose rows disagree with the inputs' rows would silently evaluate every sample's
residual against another sample's material.

    The residual of an exact solution is exactly the stencil's dispersion error.

    A homogeneous plane wave with p_hat parallel to k and omega = c_p |k| (or p_hat
    perpendicular to k and omega = c_s |k|) satisfies the continuous Navier equation
    identically.  Discretely, each axis' derivative replaces k_axis by
    k_axis * ratio(k_axis dx), and for these four cases the modified wavevector stays
    parallel to the original, so the whole residual collapses to

        R = rho omega^2 (1 - ratio(theta_axis)^2) u,      theta_axis = |k_axis| dx

    for both the P and the S branch, and for both propagation directions -- the
    Lame constants cancel out entirely.  At 8 points per wavelength that is 2.3% for
    an axial wave and 0.6% for a diagonal one, the diagonal being four times smaller
    because its per-axis theta is smaller by sqrt(2) and the error goes like theta^4.

    That factor of four is worth noticing: the *residual* is anisotropic even though
    the spectral truncation was deliberately made isotropic.  It is a property of the
    loss, not of the network, and it means the physics term is slightly more forgiving
    of diagonal wavefronts.  With alpha ~ 0.1 and a 2% floor it is far below the data
    term's influence, which is the argument for tolerating it rather than switching to
    a rotationally-invariant stencil.

    "Four times smaller" is the theta^4 statement; the exact symbol gives 3.839, since
    theta = 0.785 axial is not in the asymptotic regime.  The literals below are the
