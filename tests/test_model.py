"""
The operator itself.

Four things in here are load-bearing.

`test_masked_modes_are_zero_at_init_and_stay_dead_in_the_forward` is the test the
module docstring of fno2d.py promises.  The radial truncation is applied by
multiplying the weights *inside* `forward`; if someone "optimises" that away and
applies the mask once at construction, the discarded coefficients become ordinary
live parameters at the first optimiser step and the truncation silently stops being a
truncation.  Nothing else would notice: the loss would go down slightly faster, the
saved checkpoint would still load, and the isotropy argument of §6.4 would quietly be
false.  So the test perturbs the masked entries to a huge value after construction
and demands that the output not move.

`test_spectral_conv_is_exactly_discretisation_invariant` is the §4.3 claim, in the
one setting where it is exactly true rather than approximately: a band-limited input
through the spectral convolution alone.  With `norm="ortho"` on both transforms the
composed map is y = sum_k R_k c_k e^{ikx}, in which the grid appears nowhere -- so at
two resolutions the outputs must agree to floating-point at coincident points, not to
a tolerance.  Everything approximate about the full network's invariance comes from
GELU generating content above the coarse grid's Nyquist, and that is measured
separately and honestly in the test below it.

`test_spectral_conv_row_layout_is_signed_wavenumber` pins the index convention that
`SpectralConv2d`'s docstring states in words: row iy of the `[-kmax:]` block is
k_y = -(kmax - iy), *not* k_y = -iy.  Getting it backwards leaves every shape and
count intact and reverses the y direction of the learned kernel.

`test_to_double_converts_complex_parameters` guards the reason `to_double` exists at
all.  `nn.Module.double()` skips complex tensors, so the spectral weights stay
complex64 while everything around them becomes float64, and the gradient check of
§11.2 step 9 would then fail for a precision reason -- the worst kind of failure,
because the response is to relax the tolerance.
