Training objective (§7).

Four terms:

    L = L_field + gamma * L_H1 + beta * L_meas + alpha * L_phys

`L_field` is the relative L2 error on the scattered displacement phasor -- relative,
per (sample, frequency), because the scattered amplitude varies by more than an order
of magnitude across the dataset (roughly R^2 in the Rayleigh regime, and a further
factor from source-to-defect distance) and an absolute L2 would let the handful of
large, close voids supply almost the whole gradient.

`L_H1` penalises the error in the *gradient* of the field.  A pure L2 loss is
notoriously happy to blur: it will trade a sharp scattered wavefront for a smooth
approximation of the same energy, because the L2 penalty for smearing a front over
two cells is small.  The inversion reads phase at the receivers, and a smeared front
is a phase error, so the derivative has to be in the objective explicitly.
gamma = 0.1 rather than 1.0 because at 16 points per P wavelength the discrete
gradient amplifies the high-wavenumber part of the error by roughly k dx ~ 0.4-0.7,
and matching the two terms' natural scales rather than their nominal weights is what
keeps L_field in charge.

`L_meas` is the relative error at the 32 receivers, which is what the inversion
actually reads. It is reduced and normalized independently from the field loss, so
the small number of receiver pixels does not dilute it by a factor of 32/16384.
Training uses all 32 receivers by default to reduce gradient variance; callers can
request a random subset for a controlled compute/variance tradeoff.

`L_phys` is the residual of the governing equation itself, evaluated on the predicted
*total* field.  Two things are excluded from it, both for real reasons rather than
convenience: three cells at each edge, because a 4th-order stencil reaches two cells
and the derivative of the field there is not defined by data the network was given;
and a disc of three cells around the source, where the true residual is a delta
function and finite differences of it are meaningless.

What sets the ceiling on `L_phys`, and why alpha is balanced rather than fixed: the
residual is evaluated on the 128^2 network grid, which is half the solver's
resolution, so the 4th-order stencil's own dispersion error (3 (k dx)^4 / 640, about
1e-3 relative at 9 points per shear wavelength) is a floor the network cannot go
below no matter how right it is.  The coefficient transition at the void boundary is
0.82 network cells wide (10-90%), which is *narrower* than the five-point stencil is
wide, so the stencil straddles it everywhere along the interface and adds a second
floor there.  A fixed alpha would therefore either be swamped or would spend the
network's capacity fitting discretisation error.  `balance_alpha` sets alpha from the
ratio of gradient norms so the physics term contributes a chosen *fraction* of the
data term's gradient, which is a statement about influence rather than about units.

    freqs   [B, F]        frequency per column, in units of f_c
    src_idx [B]           source index

    `erode` cells are removed from each edge on top of the two the stencil already
    costs: 2 for the stencil, 1 more because the *coefficient* fields are also
    differentiated in the divergence, so the outermost usable cell needs its
    neighbours' coefficients too.  ERODE_CELLS is defined in config as
    STENCIL_HALF_WIDTH + 1 for exactly this reason.

    The frequency axis is flattened B-major (`repeat_interleave`), so row `b`'s F
    frequencies are consecutive and a label tensor shaped [B, F, ...] flattens to match
    with a plain `reshape`.  This is the opposite convention to `features.pack_inputs`,
    which is F-major because the *network* consumes one frequency per forward pass; the
    two are not interchangeable and mixing them silently pairs the wrong omega with the
    wrong field.

    `interface_weight` is review §3.7's objection.  The default weight is the solid
    fraction 1 - chi, which is zero exactly on the void boundary -- and the void boundary
    is where the traction-free condition lives, i.e. the only place the scattering
    problem is actually posed.  A physics loss that is blind there is not weakly
    enforcing the boundary condition, it is not enforcing it at all; what it constrains
    is the Navier equation in a medium that happens to have a hole in it.

    Setting `interface_weight = w` restores a band of weight `w` around the chi = 0.5
    contour, `interface_cells` network cells wide on each side.  The band is built by
    dilating `4 chi (1 - chi)` -- which peaks at 1 on the contour -- with a max filter,
    rather than used directly, and the reason is a measurement: the interface is 1.6
    *fine* cells wide, so on the network grid chi goes from 0.03 to 0.97 inside a single
    cell and `4 chi (1 - chi)` alone is nonzero on at most one cell per boundary normal,
    where 1 - chi is already larger than it.  Used directly the knob would change the
    weight sum by nothing at all.  Dilation also selects the right set: the 4th-order
    stencil reaches 2 cells, so `STENCIL_HALF_WIDTH` is the radius over which a cell's
    residual is contaminated by the discontinuity, and that band is precisely what the
    default weight discards.

    It defaults to 0 because the residual in the band is genuinely large -- the field is
    not smooth on the stencil's scale there, so the finite difference of the *exact*
    solution has an O(1) error and the term would be minimised by smoothing the true
    answer.  Turn it on only with a weight small enough that the term informs rather than
    dominates, and read `validate.check_physics_residual_on_labels`, which reports the
    residual with and without the band on labels the solver produced, first.
