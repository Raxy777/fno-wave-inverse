Single source of truth for every number in the architecture document.

Nothing else in the repository is allowed to hard-code a physical or numerical

Run this file directly to print the full sizing table and execute every

That is the "verification script" §3.5 implies: it recomputes the mode budget,
the CFL limit, the ppw table, the wrap-around bound and the parameter counts

# Absorbing layer (§3.6)
#
# The document says "15 cells".  That is 15 cells at the *network* resolution;
# at the solver resolution (dx twice as fine) the same physical thickness is 30
# cells, which is what the solver needs.  Expressed as a thickness this is
# ~1 lambda_p, which is the honest way to state it.
#
# WHAT THIS LAYER IS.  It is a graded sponge: a polynomial-profile damping term added
# to the velocity update inside the layer (`solver/fdtd_elastic.py:absorber_profile`).
# It is NOT a perfectly matched layer.  A split-field or CFS PML stretches the
# coordinate in the complex plane and is reflectionless for all angles and all
# frequencies at the continuous level; a sponge is not matched at all, and its
# reflection coefficient depends on the grading profile, the layer thickness in
# wavelengths, and the angle of incidence.  R_TARGET below is the value the *design
# formula* for a graded damping profile aims at -- it is a design input, not a
# measurement, and `solver/validate.py:check_absorber_reflection` measures the artefact
# the layer actually leaves and compares it against GATE_ABSORBER_REFLECTION instead of
# assuming the formula.  It does that by differencing the production acquisition against
# the same acquisition in a padded open domain, rather than by fitting a normal-incidence
# reflection coefficient: sources sit RING_INSET_NET cells from the layer, so it is
# struck at every angle out to grazing, and grazing is where a sponge is worst.
# (`check_absorber` is a different and weaker test: it measures how much energy is left
# in the domain at t_end, which a layer could pass while still reflecting, so both are
# run.)
#
# The names ABSORBER_* are primary.  The PML_* spellings are retained as aliases
# because they appear throughout the solver and the notebooks, but nothing in this
# project implements a PML and the docstrings no longer claim one.
#
# Consequence for scope: an absorbing outer boundary models an *open domain* -- an
# unbounded medium containing one defect.  It does not model the reflecting edges of a
# finite specimen, and any inversion result here is a result about the open-domain
# problem.  Stated once, here, so §1.4's scope limits are complete.
#
# THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE MEASURED, NOT DESIGNED.  v2.0 used 30 fine cells, p = 2,
# R_target = 1e-4, on the reasoning that a smaller R_target is a better layer.  Against
# an open domain (the production acquisition with the physical region padded by 208 fine
# cells, converged in the padding) that layer leaves **22.3%** on the incident ring field
# and 6.3% on the scattered field -- 11x over GATE_ABSORBER_REFLECTION, and at the time
# the largest single term in check 7's cavity error budget.  Its per-frequency signature
# falls 31.0% -> 15.3% across the band, which is what a layer too thin at the *low* end
# looks like: 30 cells is 0.62 lambda_p at FREQS[0].
#
# 42 designs were measured on that reference (`validate.check_absorber_reflection` is
# the same measurement, kept as check 9).  Incident-field artefact, rel-L2:
#
#     thickness, at R_target = 1e-2:
#        cells  lam_p(f_lo)  cost    p=4    p=5    p=6

#              R=3e-1  1e-1   3e-2   1e-2   1e-3   1e-4
#        p=3        -     -  1.57%  2.00%  3.01%  3.92%
#        p=4    8.30% 2.21%  1.02%  1.20%  1.84%  2.42%
#        p=5        -     -  0.97%  1.05%  1.51%  1.93%
#
# Three findings, none of them guessable from the design formula.  (1) Thickness in
# wavelengths dominates everything and saturates near 1.2 lambda_p(f_lo); below ~1
# lambda_p no choice of p or R_target reaches the gate, because 44 cells bottoms out at
# 3.7% and 36 at 8.1%.  (2) Order buys about a factor of two at fixed thickness and then
# saturates too (p = 6 is no better than p = 5).  (3) R_target has an interior *minimum*,
# and the production value was on the wrong side of it.  d_0 ~ -ln(R_target), so a
# smaller target steepens the profile, and for an unmatched layer it is the gradient of
# d that reflects; the WKB round-trip attenuation is R_target independently of thickness
# and order, so lowering it buys transmission the layer does not need while paying in
# reflection.  The two mechanisms cross near 3e-2 here, and the crossing moves *up* as
# the layer thins (44 cells is best at 1e-1), exactly as that reading predicts.
#
# Chosen: 60 fine cells, p = 4, R_target = 3e-2 -> 1.02% incident, per-frequency 2.0% ->
# 0.6%, i.e. within a factor of two of the gate at every frequency instead of failing at
# all of them.  Both knobs are on the flat bottom of the table above (p = 5 is 0.05
# points better, which is inside the reference's own convergence), so the choice is not
# perched on a cliff.  The cost is (256 + 120)^2 / 316^2 = 1.42x on every solve in the
# project, which is charged to dataset generation, physics-loss evaluation and every
# validation check; it is paid because a 22% boundary artefact is not a small
# perturbation of a scattering label, and because `data/datasets/` was empty when this
# changed, so no existing label had to be regenerated.  N_ABSORBER_FINE, ABSORBER_ORDER

# sigmoid thinner than the cell that samples it, and the fitted amplitude ratio crossing
# 1.0 between the last two (0.9885 -> 1.0002 -> 1.0130) is what identifies the branches:
# a sub-cell sigmoid is a staircase, and a staircase over-scatters.  Tripling dx at

# effectively free masses (the coupling length sqrt(VOID_STIFFNESS_FLOOR) lambda_s is
# a hundredth of a cell, so nothing propagates inside), and the first layer of them
# rides on the interface as an added mass.  The load per unit area is rho dx omega^2 u

# problem at centres.  The failure is at the *faces*: rho_vy = avg_plus(rho, -2)
# averages a one-cell density jump arithmetically while the 4th-order stress stencil

# Step 1b: the solver's void against the analytic traction-free cavity, on the
# receiver ring, absolutely (no fitted scale or phase).  0.12 is an error budget, not
# a round number, and it is quoted here because a gate that a measurement was tuned
# to meet is worth nothing.  Measured over the whole specified radius range: 8.6% at
# R = 0.4 lambda_s, 7.8% at 0.8, 9.3% at 1.2, with amplitude ratio 0.989 and phase
# +0.025 rad at the worst radius.  What is accounted for:
#
#   ~1.9%  the incident field itself, i.e. the illumination the void scatters, which is
#          what check_green_incident reads with the production source
#   ~1.8%  the absorber acting on the scattered field on its way to the ring, which is
#          the second number check_absorber_reflection reports
#   ~2%    the circle's area on a fine grid (chi.sum() matches pi R^2 / dx^2 to 0.4%,
#          but the boundary is sampled, not conformal)
#   ~1%    the residual of the A-scan sampling model, which is exact only for a plane
#          wave at normal incidence
#
# ~3.4% in quadrature against 9.3% measured, and the gap is the point.  Before the
# absorber was redesigned these four terms were ~3.6/6.3/2/1 = 7.6% against 10.4%, so
# fixing a 22% boundary artefact moved the cavity error by one point.  What is left is
# not a discretisation and check 8 is the evidence: refining dx threefold at fixed
# physical interface width moves it by 0.2 points, and the width itself is at the
# bottom of its own U.  It is the *void model*.  A cavity has zero impedance; this one
# has sqrt(VOID_STIFFNESS_FLOOR * VOID_DENSITY_SCALE) = 1e-3 of the solid's, over a
# transition 1.65 fine cells wide, and both floors exist because the scheme diverges
# without them (see geometry/sdf.py:material_fields).  So roughly 9% is the price of
# representing a traction-free boundary as a soft light inclusion on a fixed grid, and
# it is a *model* error that no amount of mesh refinement removes.  Quoting it as such
# is the honest version of §2.4.
#
# The gate stays at 0.12 rather than being pulled down to 0.10: check 8 measures 12.1%
# at half the production interface width, so 0.12 is one width step above the
# measurement and fails if the interface, the void floors or the absorber regress,
# while passing across the whole radius range.  Tighten it by making the void a real
# cavity -- an explicit traction-free boundary condition on a cut cell -- not by

# Shape-appropriate success (§9).  GATE_POSITION_LS scores a *centre*, which is the
# whole story only for a circle whose radius is also right, and is not size-normalised:
# 0.10 lambda_s is a 25% miss on the smallest void in the box and an 8% miss on the
# largest.  It also cannot express an error in an ellipse's axes or orientation, or a
# two-void recovery that found one void twice.  So the primary score for the transfer
# families is the soft-indicator IoU, measured at the trained interface width on the
# network grid, with permutation-invariant blob matching for multi-void families.
#
# The threshold is calibrated against the position gate rather than invented: a circle
# displaced by exactly GATE_POSITION_LS with a perfect radius gives IoU 0.829 at
# R = 0.4 lambda_s, 0.855 at 0.6 and 0.908 at 1.2.  0.80 is therefore a hair more

    With DOWNSAMPLE = 2 there is no fine cell centred on a network cell centre:
    the network centre sits on the corner shared by fine cells 2i+P and 2i+1+P,
    so `net_to_fine` picks the lower-left of the four and the true source sits
    dx_fine/2 = dx_net/4 below and left of nominal.  That is a real 0.0156
    lambda_p offset, and the reason to expose it here rather than let each caller
    recompute (ix+0.5)*dx_net is that the inversion's forward model and the
    physics loss both need the source location: a quarter-cell inconsistency
    between where the solver put the force and where the loss thinks it is
    appears as a small fixed phase error, i.e. as a bias in the recovered
    position, which is exactly the quantity being measured.

    Not worth removing by moving to DOWNSAMPLE = 3 -- an odd factor would align
    exactly, but it would cost 2.25x the solver work for an offset that is
    identical in every simulation and therefore cancels out of every difference.
    Worth *knowing about*, which is the point of writing it down.

    Physical (x, y) of the *point force* of source i: half a fine cell above
    `source_position(i)`.

    The force is added to `vy`, and on a staggered grid `vy[j, i]` does not live at
    the centre of cell (j, i) -- it lives on the y-face at (x_i, y_j + dx_fine/2)
    (the same offset `absorber_profile` is evaluated at with `shift_y=0.5`).  So the
    delta the solver actually applies sits dx_fine/2 = 0.0156 lambda_p above the
    cell centre.

    That is 0.26 rad of shear phase at the top of the band -- larger than
    GATE_CAVITY_PHASE_RAD -- so an analytic reference evaluated at
    `source_position` disagrees with the solver by more than the gate allows for
    reasons that have nothing to do with the solver being wrong.  This is the
    position `solver/cavity.py` must be given; `source_position` remains the cell
    centre because that is what the figures, the acquisition metadata and the
    regressor's source features mean, and because the offset is identical in every
    simulation and cancels from every difference of two solves.

    The remaining discrepancy is a form factor, not a position: the discrete delta
    is 1/dx^2 spread over one fine cell rather than a true point, which multiplies
    the radiated field by sinc(k_x dx/2) sinc(k_y dx/2) ~ 1 - (k dx)^2/24, i.e.
    0.3% at f_max.  Below every gate here, and not removable by moving a point.
