"""
The Fourier neural operator (§6.2 - §6.5).

Architecture, in one line: lift 12 -> 32 pointwise, four Fourier blocks, project
32 -> 4 pointwise.  No normalisation layers anywhere.

Three decisions in here are worth being able to defend out loud.

**Radial mode truncation, applied in `forward`.**  The retained set is
{k : |k| <= KMAX} on the integer lattice, not the square {|k_x|, |k_y| <= KMAX}
that the reference FNO implementation uses.  The square keeps corner modes out to
|k| = sqrt(2) KMAX along the diagonals, so a square truncation is anisotropic: it
resolves diagonal wavenumbers 41% better than axial ones.  For an operator whose
kernel is, in the homogeneous limit, a function of |k| alone (§4.4 -- the Christoffel
matrix depends on the direction of k only through the outer product k k^T, and its
eigenvalues depend only on |k|), that anisotropy is a modelling error the network has
to spend capacity undoing.  It also breaks the rotational symmetry of the physics in
a way that shows up as a preferred scattering direction, which is precisely the kind
of artefact that would discredit a defect-localisation result.

The mask is applied inside `forward`, multiplying the weights, rather than being
baked in once at construction.  If it were only applied at init, the discarded
coefficients would be ordinary live parameters again from the first optimiser step
and the truncation would quietly stop being a truncation.  Masking in the forward
pass makes the retained set a property of the operator instead of a property of the
initialisation.  The masked entries are also zeroed at init so that
`effective_params()` and the parameter file agree.

**No normalisation layers.**  BatchNorm would make the output depend on the other
samples in the batch, which is fatal here: the inversion (§8) differentiates the
network with respect to geometry for a *single* sample, and a batch-dependent output
means a batch-dependent gradient.  LayerNorm/InstanceNorm would divide by the field's
own amplitude, destroying the radius information the same way per-sample target
normalisation would (§7.1).  Stability instead comes from the block being close to
the identity at initialisation: the spectral weights start at scale 1/(d_in d_out),
so `v + act(W v + K v)` is a small perturbation of `v` in every block.

**Domain padding, applied in `forward`.**  `rfft2` treats its input as one period of a
periodic signal.  The scattered field here is not periodic: the absorber is cropped
away, so the field is nonzero on all four edges, and the sources sit about 0.2 length
units from the boundary.  Without padding, a wave leaving the right edge re-enters on
the left through every spectral block, and the network has to spend capacity learning to
cancel a wrap-around that the physics does not have.  The fix is the standard one:
zero-pad the lifted features by `pad` cells on every side, run the blocks on the larger
grid, and crop back before the projection.  The wrap-around distance becomes
`2 * pad` cells instead of zero.

Two consequences, both handled here rather than left to the caller:

* A mode index is a physical wavenumber only for a fixed domain length.  Padding from
  N to N + 2*pad cells lengthens the domain, so index k now means a *lower* physical
  wavenumber, by a factor N / (N + 2*pad).  `padded_kmax` rescales the retained index
  so the physical band is unchanged; `build(..., pad=p)` does it automatically.
* `pad` is stored in cells of the reference grid (`cfg.N_NET`) and rescaled with the
  resolution at call time, so the same weights at 2x resolution see the same physical
  padding -- the discretisation-invariance claim of section 4.3 survives.

`pad=0` is exactly the previous behaviour and adds no parameters, so old checkpoints
load unchanged.

**norm='ortho' on both transforms.**  Composed over a forward and an inverse, the
overall scaling is 1/N^2 either way, so this is the same operator as the default
convention -- but the intermediate spectral coefficients stay O(field) instead of
O(N^2 field).  At N = 128 that is a factor of 16384, about four of float32's seven
significant digits, spent for nothing.
